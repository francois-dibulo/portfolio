    shortDescription: 'A hands-on simulator for mastering Google Cloud architectures.',
    description: 'I have spent over a decade building production systems on Google Cloud, mostly learning on the job and only ever touching a fraction of the platform. While preparing for the Cloud Engineer certification, I realized how hard it is to truly remember dozens of services or understand when I would use them and how they fit together in real scenarios. So I built CloudTutor, an interactive learning simulator that explains the most widely used Google Cloud services and challenges you to design common architectures step by step.',

    description: 'SuperFive is a multiplayer challenge where players compete through a sequence of five random hypercasual games. Each game has time- or score-based objectives, and losing a round sends you back to the previous one - creating fast, tense matches. Beyond building the multiplayer platform, matchmaking engine and infrastructure, I created more than 12 hypercasual games and published the superfive.io NPM package, allowing external developers to build and contribute new games.',

    shortDescription: 'Building a conversational AI game-creation platform.',
    description: 'I joined the UpIt (FRVR) founding team to help build a platform where anyone can create games directly in the browser using natural conversation. The system translates user intent into actual games, including code, logic, sound effects, music, and graphics, all powered by generative AI, agents and retrieval. Working closely with the founder and CTO of FRVR, I helped shape the early architecture, roadmap and real-time editor that makes game creation possible.',

    shortDescription: 'An interactive coloring session for kids.',
    description: 'Dibulo turns childrens hand-colored paper templates into animated characters inside themed worlds (Sealand, Train Express, Space, and more). I had the idea already for 10 years in my mind and then started the execution during an accelerator program in Madeira, where I validated the concept with dozens of experts and parents. Dibulo has since been used in numerous kindergartens, with session lengths averaging 45 minutes. I also published several companion coloring books on Amazon, including a best-seller on Amazon.nl. The product spans web, computer vision, real-time interactions, and a full backend ecosystem.',

    description: 'AirConsole is a real-time local multiplayer gaming platform where smartphones act as gamepads. I joined on day one as the founding engineer and contributed far beyond engineering: helping bring AirConsole to major OTT providers (TrueDigital, Swisscom, Telefónica, XLHome), Android TV ecosystems (Amazon, Xiaomi), and even platforms like Atari and Steam. Later, I worked closely with the partnerships team on the technical PoC that brought gaming into BMW in-car entertainment systems. AirConsole grew to 10M+ users and CHF 1M+ ARR, and was successfully acquired by KPIT Technologies. During my time I created 10 HTML5 games, which have been played by millions  players.',
