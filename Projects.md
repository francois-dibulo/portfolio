# SuperFive.io

Role: Founder
Year: 2025

## Description:
On SuperFive you play a sequence of 5 random hypercasual games against other players. The first one to win all 5 games wins the match.

The catch is, that you have either limited time or you need to reach a certain score. If you lose a game, you fall back to the previous one.

Besides creating the platform, match making and so on, I created over 12 hypercasual games and the superfive.io NPM package, so that other devs can contribute creating games.

# CloudTutor.app

Role: Founder
Year: 2025
Url: https://cloudtutor.app

## Description:

I spent over 10 years building architectures with Google Cloud, but as so often it was more a "learning while doing" and I only touched a slice of all the GCP services. I started to learn for a Cloud Engineer Certificate, but had trouble remember all the services and als to understand real live scenarios. That's why I built CloudTutor, which helps you to understand the most popular Google Cloud services and challenges you to build common architectures.
